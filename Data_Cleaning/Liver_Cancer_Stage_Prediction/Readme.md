# Liver Cancer Stage Prediction System

This repository contains a Flask-based web application to predict the stage of liver cancer based on user inputs. The model used for predictions is pre-trained and saved as `best_model.pkl`. The project also includes a frontend designed with HTML for user interaction and a sample dataset cleaning notebook for reference.

## Features

- **Liver Cancer Stage Prediction**:
  - Takes user inputs such as age, gender, liver function tests, and medical history.
  - Predicts the cancer stage (0 to 4) using a pre-trained machine learning model.
  
- **Stage Information**:
  - Provides details about the predicted stage, including recommended diagnostics and treatment options.

- **Frontend**:
  - Interactive form for inputting medical details.
  - Displays the predicted stage and corresponding information.

- **Backend**:
  - Flask application serves as the backend, processes user inputs, and returns predictions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Flask
- NumPy
- Joblib

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/siddhantbhattarai/liver-stage-prediction.git
   cd liver-stage-prediction
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python liver_stage_prediction.py
   ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

1. Open the web application in your browser.
2. Fill out the form with the following inputs:
   - Age, Gender, ALT, AST, Total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin, Albumin levels.
   - Medical history details such as Alcohol Consumption, Hepatitis B infection, Cirrhosis history.
3. Submit the form.
4. View the predicted liver cancer stage and corresponding diagnostic information.

## Test Cases

Refer to the image in the `test-cases` directory (`test-cases/test-cases.png`) for examples of inputs and expected outputs.

---

## Notes

- The pre-trained model (`models/best_model.pkl`) was trained on anonymized and cleaned data using machine learning techniques.
- The `Notebook/Data_Cleaning_Exercise.ipynb` file provides insights into the data preparation and cleaning process.
